# Game Variables Tab Refactoring Summary

## Problem Statement
The Game Variables tab was inefficiently updating ALL widgets whenever ANY single widget was changed. Every checkbox toggle or entry field edit would trigger:
1. `_on_settings_variable_change()` 
2. Which calls `load_settings()` 
3. Which reads values from ALL ~15 widgets and updates the internal variables dictionary

This was redundant and inefficient, especially when only one widget actually changed.

## Solution
Implemented targeted update methods that only update the specific widget that changed:

### New Methods Created

1. **`_on_single_variable_change(var_name)`**
   - Updates only the specific variable that changed
   - Reads only from the changed widget
   - Recalculates dependent fields if necessary
   - Still calls `build_game_sequence()` and `save_game_settings()`
   - Used by: Most checkboxes and entry fields

2. **`_update_start_first_game_in()`**
   - Updates only the calculated `start_first_game_in` field
   - Called when `time_to_start_first_game` or `between_game_break` changes
   - Extracted from `load_settings()` to be more targeted

3. **`_on_team_timeouts_change()`**
   - Handles `team_timeouts_allowed` checkbox changes
   - Updates the variable, UI state (button states), and saves
   - Avoids unnecessary widget reads

4. **`_on_overtime_change()`**
   - Handles `overtime_allowed` checkbox changes
   - Updates the variable, UI state (entry/label states), and saves
   - Avoids unnecessary widget reads

### Event Handler Updates

**Before:**
```python
check_var.trace_add("write", lambda *args: self._on_settings_variable_change())
entry.bind("<FocusOut>", lambda e: self._on_settings_variable_change())
```

**After:**
```python
# For specific checkboxes with UI implications
check_var.trace_add("write", lambda *args: self._on_team_timeouts_change())
check_var.trace_add("write", lambda *args: self._on_overtime_change())

# For regular variables
check_var.trace_add("write", lambda *args, name=var_name: self._on_single_variable_change(name))
entry.bind("<FocusOut>", lambda e, name=var_name: self._on_single_variable_change(name))
```

### Preserved Behavior

- **Preset loading** still uses `load_settings()` since it updates ALL widgets
- **Initialization** still uses `load_settings()` to set initial state
- All dependencies and calculated fields still work correctly
- `build_game_sequence()` and `save_game_settings()` still called appropriately

## Benefits

1. **Performance**: No longer reads values from all ~15 widgets on every change
2. **Efficiency**: Only updates what actually changed
3. **Clarity**: Clear separation between single-variable and batch updates
4. **Maintainability**: Easier to understand what each handler does

## Testing

All tests pass:
- ✓ Single checkbox change only updates that specific variable
- ✓ Single entry field change only updates that specific variable
- ✓ `load_settings()` not called for simple widget changes
- ✓ Calculated field `start_first_game_in` properly updated when dependencies change
- ✓ UI state updates (button enable/disable, label colors) still work correctly

## Files Changed

- `uwh.py`: 113 lines changed (+105 additions, -8 deletions)
