# Game Logic Changes for Underwater Hockey Scoring Desk Kit

## Overview
This document describes the changes made to fix the game logic for proper overtime and sudden death transitions.

## Requirements Implemented

### 1. Break Goal Overtime Trigger
**Requirement**: If a goal is entered during the 'between_game_break' period and this makes the scores even, immediately enter the 'overtime_game_break' period (if overtime is enabled).

**Implementation**: 
- Already working correctly in `handle_tiebreak_after_break()` method
- When in 'between_game_break' and scores become tied via break goal, system immediately transitions to overtime

### 2. Overtime to Sudden Death Transition
**Requirement**: After the 'overtime_second_half' period, if the scores are still even, enter the 'sudden_death_game_break' period (if sudden death is enabled).

**Implementation**: 
- Updated `next_period()` method to detect when overtime just finished
- Added logic to check if last period was 'overtime_second_half'
- If overtime finished with tied scores, transitions to sudden death periods

### 3. Between Game Break Loop to First Half
**Requirement**: After the end of 'between_game_break', if no overtime/sudden death is needed, loop to the 'First Half' period.

**Implementation**:
- Fixed `next_period()` end-of-game logic
- When between_game_break ends with no tie (or no overtime/sudden death available), system now goes to First Half (index 1) for new game

## Code Changes

### Primary Changes in `uwh.py`

#### Method: `next_period()` (lines ~455-510)

**Key Changes**:
1. **Overtime Detection**: Added logic to detect when overtime just finished by checking if the last period in the current periods list has setting_name 'overtime_second_half'

2. **Phase-Aware Logic**: Differentiated between:
   - End of regular game (check overtime first, then sudden death)
   - End of overtime (check sudden death only)

3. **Proper Game Loop**: Changed end-of-game behavior to go to First Half instead of between_game_break (which caused infinite loop)

#### Updated Logic Flow:
```
When period ends and we're at end of periods:
├── If scores tied:
│   ├── If just finished overtime:
│   │   ├── Check sudden death enabled → go to sudden death
│   │   └── Else → go to between_game_break
│   └── If finished regular game:
│       ├── Check overtime enabled → go to overtime
│       └── Check sudden death enabled → go to sudden death
└── If scores not tied → go to First Half (new game)
```

## Testing

All scenarios have been tested and verified:

✓ **Scenario 1**: Regular game ending with tie → overtime
✓ **Scenario 2**: Overtime ending with tie → sudden death  
✓ **Scenario 3**: Break goal during between_game_break creating tie → overtime
✓ **Scenario 4**: Between game break ending with no tie → First Half
✓ **Enabled/Disabled States**: All transitions respect overtime/sudden death enabled settings

## UI Impact

- No UI changes were required
- All existing UI functionality preserved
- Game logic now properly handles all transition scenarios
- Application screenshot included: `app_screenshot.png`

## Backward Compatibility

- All existing functionality preserved
- No breaking changes to API or UI
- Settings and configuration remain unchanged
- Existing game saves/states unaffected
