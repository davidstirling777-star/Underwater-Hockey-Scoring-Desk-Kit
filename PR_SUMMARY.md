# Pull Request Summary: play_sound_with_volume Signature Verification

## Overview

This PR addresses the issue regarding the `play_sound_with_volume()` function signature to ensure it matches the intended specification and resolves any potential 'takes 7 positional arguments but 8 were given' errors.

## Problem Statement

Verify that all definitions and calls to `play_sound_with_volume()` match the intended signature:

```python
def play_sound_with_volume(filename, sound_type, enable_sound, pips_volume, siren_volume, 
                           air_volume, water_volume, siren_duration=1.5)
```

## Investigation Results

After comprehensive analysis of the entire codebase, **no code changes were required**. The investigation revealed that:

1. ✅ All function definitions already have the correct signature
2. ✅ All function calls already pass the correct number of arguments  
3. ✅ No signature mismatch errors exist in the codebase

## Files Analyzed

### Function Definitions
- `sound.py` line 548: `play_sound_with_volume()` - ✅ Correct (8 params: 7 required + 1 optional)
- `sound.py` line 314: `_play_sound_with_volume_sync()` - ✅ Correct (8 params: 7 required + 1 optional)

### Function Calls
- `uwh.py`: 10 calls analyzed - ✅ All correct (all pass 8 arguments)
  - Lines: 1849, 1949, 2955, 2993, 3552, 3561, 3581, 3592, 3695, 3726
